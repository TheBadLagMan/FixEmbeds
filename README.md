# FixEmbeds
Basic code to fix twitter and tiktok embeds in Discord. Credit goes to original creators of FixTweet, fxTikTok, and fxreddit for making the embeds work.

How the bot works is that is detects links starting in http or https and from there it detects Twitter, Tiktok, and Reddit links.
Upon isolating these links they are modified to include their embeds and the bot replies with these links (and only the fixed links)
All my bot does is detect links and replace a few characters the real credit goes to the developers who created workarounda to fix Discord embeds 

Thanks to https://github.com/FixTweet/FxTwitter, https://tfxktok.com/, and https://github.com/MinnDevelopment/fxreddit for making this possible.

Self-hosting instructions for the bot to come soon?
